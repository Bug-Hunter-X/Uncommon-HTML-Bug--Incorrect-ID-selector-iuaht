This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML involving incorrect selection of elements by ID when the ID starts with a number. The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  The core issue stems from the incorrect use of `document.getElementById()`, which fails to select elements with IDs that begin with numbers. The solution highlights using a valid ID selector format.  Please refer to the code comments for detailed explanation.
